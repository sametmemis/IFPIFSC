Abstract:

Intuitionistic fuzzy parameterized intuitionistic fuzzy soft matrices (ifpifs-matrices), proposed by Enginoğlu and Arslan in 2020, are worth utilizing in data classification in supervised
learning due to coming into prominence with their ability to model decision-making problems. This study aims to define the concepts metrics, quasi-, semi-, and pseudo-metrics and similarities, quasi-,
semi-, and pseudo-similarities over ifpifs-matrices; develop a new classifier by using them; and apply it to data classification. To this end, it develops a new classifier, i.e., Intuitionistic Fuzzy Parameterized
Intuitionistic Fuzzy Soft Classifier (IFPIFSC), based on six pseudo-similarities proposed herein. Moreover, this study performs IFPIFSC’s simulations using 20 datasets provided in the UCI Machine
Learning Repository and obtains its performance results via five performance metrics, accuracy (Acc), precision (Pre), recall (Rec), macro F-score (MacF), and micro F-score (MicF). It also compares the
aforementioned results with those of 10 well-known fuzzy-based classifiers and 5 non-fuzzy-based classifiers. As a result, the mean Acc, Pre, Rec, MacF, and MicF results of IFPIFSC, in comparison with
fuzzy-based classifiers, are 94.45%, 88.21%, 86.11%, 87.98%, and 89.62%, the best scores, respectively, and with non-fuzzy-based classifiers, are 94.34%, 88.02%, 85.86%, 87.65%, and 89.44%, the best scores,
respectively. Later, this study conducts the statistical evaluations of the performance results using a non-parametric test (Friedman) and a post hoc test (Nemenyi). The critical diagrams of the Nemenyi
test manifest the performance differences between the average rankings of IFPIFSC and 10 of the 15 are greater than the critical distance (4.0798). Consequently, IFPIFSC is a convenient method for
data classification. Finally, to present opportunities for further research, this study discusses the applications of ifpifs-matrices for machine learning and how to improve IFPIFSC.
